Micro-Professor MPF for 8051 Instruction Set

Micro-Professor is a system wich can simulate any assembly (`8051` in this case) code on it's RAM which is inputted as Opcodes and Operands -in HexDecimal mode- before execution.
It has a funny name which comes from combination of Micro-Processor and Professor which means it can be as a Professor (which may know all the instruction set) that run your code in its head and show it's answer to you.

Main challeng is the fact that executing these instructions is normally done inside the `8051` by hardware dedicated to each `Fetch`, `Execute` and `Run` cycle and here we should simulate them by a software program using 8051 insturctions.
